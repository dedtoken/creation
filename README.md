Project Overview

DD Token (DDT) is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token with the main use as
payment currency for every trades on our all-made-in-Italy, revolutionary
platform ddplatform.net.
We came up with this idea to allow people to trade every kind of
products and services divided by category and country.
We decided to build DD Token in the Ethereum network because it is a
well known network, easy to find, with a big existing infrastructure for
tokens and many exchanges. The other reason is the speed and minimal
cost of transactions.

But why Invest in DDT?

Because simplicity is the base of perfection and there's no perfection
without simplicity.
We don't offer services that are complicated and difficult to manage. We
are going to offer a simple showcase where everybody can exchange
(selling trough DDT or bartering) goods and services in short times with
direct contact with the buyer. We also will make a cashback system wich
will save a percentage of DDT for those who buy.
